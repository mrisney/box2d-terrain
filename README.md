[![screen shot ](https://github.com/mrisney/box2d-terrain/blob/master/images/snowboarder.png)](#features)

This is an example of the javascript physics port of Box2DWeb and EaselJS Spriting.
The standalone Sprite sheet can be seen here

Combining EaselJS and Box2D javascript version into a rolling terrain, where the character - a snowboarder, rides up and down a sloped terrain.
Much like a sphere rolling in a bowl.
